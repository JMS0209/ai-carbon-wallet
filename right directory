backend/
Subfolder	Expected Contents
api/	Serverless functions (e.g. Next.js API routes), integrations with Oasis Sapphire, Sui, or USDC
collectors/	Scripts to gather AI usage data (e.g. from Ecologits.ai or CodeCarbon)
scheduler/	Cron-like tasks for syncing subgraph data, refreshing oracle feeds, or billing

No clear integration points for:

Oasis Sapphire signer logic

Trustless Oracle fetchers

Sui zkLogin or kiosk triggers

USDC micropayment handlers

No subgraph sync logic — this might belong in scheduler/ or a dedicated subgraphs/ folder

No carbon credit purchasing logic — could be in api/ or a new payments/ folder

Modular Suggestions
Move signer logic and Sapphire integration out of api/ into oasis/

Keep Sui logic isolated in sui/ for clarity and scalability

Create payments/ to handle USDC flows and billing

Add subgraphs/ folder if you plan to manage Graph mappings or sync logic
